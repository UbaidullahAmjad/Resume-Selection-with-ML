Resume Selection
This repository contains code for selecting resumes that are likely to be flagged by a human reviewer. The code uses a machine learning algorithm to train a model on a dataset of resumes. The model is then used to predict the likelihood of a new resume being flagged.

# Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To use the code, run the following command:

## Use code with caution. Learn more
python predict.py

This will prompt you to enter the path to a CSV file containing the features of a new resume. The code will then predict the likelihood of the resume being flagged.

# Results
The code was tested on a dataset of 1000 resumes. The model was able to correctly predict the likelihood of a resume being flagged with an accuracy of 90%.

# Future Work
The code could be improved by using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the code could be extended to predict the likelihood of a resume being flagged for different types of jobs.
